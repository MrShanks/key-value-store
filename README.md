# key-value-store

## Purpose:
Key value store is a study project to better understand how a cloud native technology should be thought from the very beginning.

## The idea:
The idea behind this project is to recreate a key value store with an event based architecture to be able to replay all events happened until the last saved point to restore the store in case of sudden breaks or data corruption.
